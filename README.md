# epos_ros
ROS2 interface for the EPOS controllers/Maxon motors

## Notes
Currently, the functionality is contained in the EPOSWrapper header and folder. Still need to develop and test interfaces

## Install

EposCmdLib 6.6.1.0 can be installed by running `bash install_files/install_epos_cmd_lib.bash`

## TODO:
Add EPOS Interface to do fault handling this will likely involve integration with the new system manager package (private for now)

Make some more example code
